# A simple CRUD app built with Django, React, and MobX.

![](react_django_mobx_app_2.gif)

In the backend, we have Django and Django Rest Framework. In the frontend, we have React and MobX. 

With the endpoints built on the backend, we can create a single note, update that note, 
and delete that note. List of all notes are also viewable by one endpoint.

The next step of in this app would be to use authentication in the frontend and only allow 
logged in users to create, update, delete notes in React frontend.
