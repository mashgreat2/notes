# A simple CRUD app built with Django, React, and MobX.

![](react_django_mobx_notes_app_1080.gif)

In the backend, we have Django and Django Rest Framework. In the frontend, we have React and MobX. 

With the endpoints built on the backend, we can create a single note, update that note, 
and delete that note. List of all notes are also viewable by one endpoint.

Next step of this app would be to implement authentication and only allow logged in users to create, update, delete notes.
